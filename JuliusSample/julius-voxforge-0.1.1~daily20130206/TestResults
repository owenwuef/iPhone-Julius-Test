DISCLAIMER: this is a *sanity test* only, and is *not* to be regarded as a valid test of the VoxForge Acoustic Models!
 * the speech files used for testing use a single person's voice;
 * the same person also contributed speech for the creation of the VoxForge the Acoustic Models;
 * there are only 50 audio samples in the test database - not enough for a good test;
 * the VoxForge Acoustic Models are still an alpha release with respect to Speaker Independent Speech Recognition, so please donate some speech to VoxForge,

 thanks,

 VoxForge team


Testing Acoustic Models created in: /data/svn-mirror/Nightly_Builds/AcousticModel-2013-02-06

HTK 16kHz_16bit
---------------
  Parameters:
	word insertion penalty: 0.0
	grammar scale factor: 1.0
====================== Results Analysis =======================
  Date: Wed Feb  6 03:53:07 2013
  Ref : /tmp/u80QFZDsLh/testref.mlf
  Rec : /tmp/u80QFZDsLh/recout.mlf
------------------------ Overall Results --------------------------
SENT: %Correct=62.00 [H=31, S=19, N=50]
WORD: %Corr=97.88, Acc=79.89 [H=185, D=0, S=4, I=34, N=189]
===================================================================

Julian 16kHz_16bit
------------------
  Parameters:
	word insertion penalty
	  first pass (-penalty1):0.5
	  second pass (-penalty2):100.0
	transition penalty (-iwsppenalty):-55.0 (for short-term inter-word pauses between words)

  Ref : /tmp/8T9kWeQn_H/testref.mlf
  Rec : /tmp/8T9kWeQn_H/julianProcessed
------------------------ Overall Results --------------------------
SENT: %Correct=86.00 [H=43, S=7, N=50]
WORD: %Corr=95.77, Acc=94.71 [H=181, D=3, S=5, I=2, N=189]
===================================================================

Notes:

    * the line starting with SENT gives the percentage of sentences that were recognized correctly, out of N sentences in total.
    * the line starting with WORD gives the percentage of words that were recognized correctly, out of N words in total
      However, since HTK or Julius erroneously 'added' words that are not in the audio file (i.e. insertion errors) they usually get a lower percentage accuracy rating.
    * Count definitions:
          o D - Deletion Error
          o S - Substitution Error
          o I - Insertion Error
